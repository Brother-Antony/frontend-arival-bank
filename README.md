# **Technical Test Project - FrontEnd**

## Description
This project represents my technical test for the Frontend Developer position. The application is built with key technologies, including React, TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind CSS, and Axios. It also uses universal-cookie to manage the application's cookies. The application allows users to enter initial information, validate it, and review it before progressing to the next step. Additionally, it integrates with an external API to retrieve country data.

## Usage Instructions
To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the application with `npm start`.

## Folder Structure
The project follows an organized folder structure to facilitate code navigation.

## Technologies Used
- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: JavaScript extension that enables static typing.
- Sass: Styling language.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework.
- Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
- universal-cookie: Library for handling browser cookies.

## Development Process
During development, I faced challenges in user data validation. I opted to use custom validation libraries to ensure a smooth user experience and meet the test requirements. The logic to consume data from the external API was also implemented.

## Open Issues
Currently, there are no known open issues. If you encounter any problems or wish to collaborate, please feel free to open an issue report.

## Learning and Development
One of the most exciting parts of the project was learning to integrate technologies and libraries to create an intuitive user experience. I learned how to use TypeScript for safer code and manage cookies in a React application.
